# Reporting API Reference

Paysafe's Reporting API provides endpoints for querying and generating reports based on your payments history. You can extract the data to a report in .csv format. You can retrieve the following reports using the API:

The reports you obtain from Paysafe contain data about your transactions that are more than 24 hours old. 

> **Note:** The Ids of each report are in parenthesis. 

For a detailed description on types of reports, please see [<b>Report Types</b>](https://prlocal-developer-paysafe-com.eu.paysafecorp.com/en/rest-apis/reports-api/report-types/) 

# Prerequisites
<a name="prereq" title="Prerequisites"></a>

Below are the prerequisite steps for merchant onboarding: 

1. The partner must contact the account manager to set up the account.
2. Paysafe integrations team provides the authentication credentials after the merchant account set up is complete. 

### Scope and Restrictions

* All the APIs are RESTful.
* The Direct Merchants and Platform Partners who possess the Shared API key will only use this API.
* Onboarding reports are available only to Partners. 


<a name="apikey" title="Authentication"></a>
# Authentication 

To use the Paysafe REST API, Paysafe must first set up its system for you 
and then provide an API key. 

Your API key looks something like this:
 * Key ID – PartnerXYZ
 * Key Password – B-tst1-0-51ed39e4-312d02345d3f123120881dff9bb4020a89e8ac44cdfdcecd702151182fdc952272661d290ab2e5849e31bb03deede7e

HTTP Basic Authentication sends the case-sensitive API key. To use HTTP Basic Authentication, you must send the API key credentials using the Authorization header with every request. The Authorization header is constructed as follows:
 1. Combine the Key ID and Key Password into a string separated by a colon, for example: “Key ID:Key Password”.
 2. The resulting string literal is then encoded using Base64.
 3. The authorization method and the space (that is, “Basic”) are added before the encoded string.

For example, using the Key ID and Password examples above, the header is formed as follows:

`Authorization: Basic
UGFydG5lclhZWjpCLXRzdDEtMC01MWVkMzllNC0zMTJkMDIzNDVkM2YxMjMxMjA4ODFkZmY5YmI0MDIwYTg5ZThhYzQ0Y2RmZGNlY2Q3MDIxNTExODJmZGM5NTIyNzI2NjFkMjkwYWIyZTU4NDllMzFiYjAzZGVlZGU3ZQ==`

For additional details, refer to [Authentication](https://developer.paysafe.com/en/rest-apis/reference-information/important-integration-concepts/authentication/).

> **Note:** Your Production API key will be different from your Test API key. Contact your account manager for details. You must keep your API keys safe and ensure that they are used appropriately for your needs.

# Going Live
 
Once you are satisfied with your integration to the Test environment, you must repeat the configuration changes made to your Test account on your Production account.

> **Note:** You cannot use your Test credentials to process transaction requests in the Production environment.

### Go Live Checklist
1. You must have a production account and an Onboarding Config ID for your production account.
2. You must have the API Keys for the production environment.
3. You must use the Production URL for your API calls.

> **Note:** For items 1, 2, & 3, reach out to your account manager or <integrations@paysafe.com> for any issues.

### Production URL
To process live requests with Paysafe, use the following Production URL:

`https://api.paysafe.com/reporting/v1/`

For Example:

# Webhooks
<a name="webhooks" title="Webhooks"></a>
A Webhook is an HTTP callback that is triggered when an event takes place. 

> **Note:** To receive webhooks from Paysafe, you must create a callback URL to receive the webhook that is triggered. 
Paysafe will attempt a maximum of three times to deliver the report if your webhook is unreachable. You are responsible for ensuring its continued availability.

You will receive the following webhook payload for the specified callback URL. Webhook will be delivered within 30 minutes from when the request is accepted. The payload contains a link from where you can download the report. The following payload sample illustrates this: 

```
{
  "report": {
    "status": "SUCCEEDED",
    "files": [
      "https://paysafe-ss-analytics-876548798765-ca-central-1-reports-qa.s3.ca-central-1.amazonaws.com/reportOutputs/2020_11/6cd9b563-65fa-460e-9052-c823d2d3f331/c31f2940-a47a-4130-9e4b-8d2e74ed953b.csv..."
    ]
  }
}
```
> **Note:** You can download the reports for a pre-defined period (up to seven days). 
```

Entering either only the start or the end time will throw an error. For reference, you can refer to [milliseconds Converter](https://www.currentmillis.com/)
